# Hero Animation Integration

## Goal
Integrate `neon-raymarcher` animation into the Hero section and adjust layout as per the visual design spec (text left, animation right, centered CTA).

- [x] Modify `src/components/Hero.tsx` to implement 2-column layout (Text Left, Animation Right). → Verify: `npm run dev` shows side-by-side layout.
- [x] Adjust CTA and Scroll Indicator in `src/components/Hero.tsx` (Center position, enhance contrast). → Verify: Visual check of position and readability.

## Done When
- [x] Hero section has text on the left and 3D animation on the right.
- [x] CTA is centered and clearly visible against the background.
